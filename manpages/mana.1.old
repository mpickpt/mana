.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
\fBMANA\fP
is a package that enables checkpoint\-restart for MPI jobs. 
The name MANA stands for 
``MPI\-Agnostic Network\-Agnostic Checkpointing\&''\&. 
It is designed to be compatible with most MPI implementations 
and most underlying networks. 
MANA is built on top of the DMTCP checkpointing package. 
.PP
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
 Show additional DMTCP_OPTIONS for a MANA command. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP
 Display the underlying DMTCP command 
and DMTCP_OPTIONS used, and other info. 
.PP
.SH MANA PROGRAM EXECUTION

.PP
Execute a MANA command with \-\-help for a usage statement. 
Checkpoints may be invoked: 
.TP
+ periodically: 
via the `\-\-interval\&' or `\-i\&' flag (units in seconds) 
.TP
+ under program control: 
(see 
`test/plugin/applic\-initiated\-ckpt\&'
directory) 
.TP
+ externally: 
via `mana_status \-\-checkpoint\&'
.PP
A typical workflow for using MANA after untar\&'ing is: 
.Vb
  cd dmtcp\-mana
  ./configure \-\-enable\-debug
  make \-j mana
  # Compile against libmana.so: Examples at contrib/mpi\-proxy\-split/test
  salloc \-N 2 \-q interactive \-C haswell \-t 01:00:00
  bin/mana_coordinator \-i10
  srun \-N 2 bin/mana_launch <TARGET_DIR>/ping_pong.mana.exe
  bin/mana_coordinator \-i10
  srun \-N 2 bin/mana_restart
.Ve
.PP
MANA supports most features of DMTCP, including: 
.TP
.B *
plugins to extend the functionality of DMTCP 
.TP
.B *
virtualization of pathname prefixes (plugin/pathvirt) 
.TP
.B *
modification of environment variables at restart (plugin/modify\-env) 
.TP
.B *
distinct checkpoint filenames 
(`dmtcp_launch \-\-enable\-unique\-checkpoint\-filenames`)
.br
The default is to overwrite the last checkpoint; the default is to overwrite 
the last checkpoint.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND DEBUGGING

.TP
\fBDMTCP_MANA_PAUSE or DMTCP_LAUNCH_PAUSE\fP
 DMTCP/MANA will 
pause during launch to allow `gdb attach\&' (GDB must be on same node.) 
.TP
\fBDMTCP_MANA_PAUSE\fP
 DMTCP/MANA will pause very early in restart, 
inside mtcp/mtcp_restart.c shortly before calling splitProcess() 
(intended for developers) 
.TP
\fBDMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE\fP
 DMTCP/MANA will 
pause during restart, before resuming execution, to allow `gdb 
attach\&' (GDB must be on same node.) 
.TP
\fBMPI_COLLECTIVE_P2P\fP
 For debugging only (high 
runtime overhead): If this env. var. is set, and if re\-building 
any files in contrib/mpi\-proxy\-split/mpi\-wrappers, then MPI 
collective communication calls are translated to MPI_Send/Recv 
at runtime. (Try \&'touch mpi_collective_p2p.c\&' if not re\-building.) 
.br
NOTE: You can select specific collective calls for translation
to MPI_Send/Recv by copying MPI wrappers from
mpi_collective_p2p.c
to mpi_collective_wrappers.cpp
in the mpi\-wrappers
subdirectory; or block certain
translations by adjusting \&'#ifdef/#ifndef MPI_COLLECTIVE_P2P\&'
in those files.
.TP
\fBMANA_P2P_LOG"\fP
 For debugging: Set this before 
mana_launch
in order to log the order of point\-to\-point 
calls (MPI_Send and family) for later deterministic replay. See 
details at top of 
contrib/mpi\-proxy\-split/mpi\-wrappers/p2p\-deterministic.c 
(IMPORTANT: If you checkpoint, continue running for a few minutes 
after that, for final updating of the log files.) 
.TP
\fBMANA_P2P_REPLAY"\fP
 For debugging: If a checkpoint was created 
with MANA_P2P_LOG,
then execute mana_p2p_update_logs
and set this variable before mana_restart\&.
(Currently, 
you need to set this before mana_launch,
but this may be 
fixed later.) 
.PP
To see status of ranks (especially during checkpoint), try: 
.Vb
   bin/mana_status \-\-list
.Ve
To inspect a checkpoint image from, for example, Rank 0, try: 
.Vb
   util/readdmtcp.sh ckpt_rank0/ckpt_*.dmtcp
.Ve
To debug during restart, try: 
.Vb
   srun ... env DMTCP\\_RESTART\\_PAUSE=1 mana\\_restart ... APPLICATION
   gdb APPLICATION PID  # from a different terminal
.Ve
To see the stack, you then may or may not need to try some of the following: 
.Vb
  (gdb) add\-symbol\-file bin/lh_proxy
  (gdb) source util/gdb\-dmtcp\-utils
  (gdb) add\-symbol\-files\-all
  (gdb) dmtcp
.Ve
If you are debugging the lower half internals of MANA, you may need: 
(gdb) file bin/lh_proxy 
.PP
.SH BUGS

NOTE: Compiling VASP\-5.4.4 uncovered some bugs in the combination 
of icpc\-19.0.3.199 and GNU gcc. 
The validation results were: 
.TP
.B *
icpc+gcc\-7.5.0 (built at NERSC): Fails at runtime on VASP
.br 
during restart unless configured with: 
.br
\&./configure CXXFLAGS=\&'\-fno\-omit\-frame\-pointer
.br
\-fno\-optimize\-sibling\-calls\&'
.TP
.B *
icpc+gcc\-9.3.0: Works correctly 
.TP
.B *
icpc_gcc\-10.1.0 (built at NERSC): Fails to link using ld\-2.35.1
