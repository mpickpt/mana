# NOTE:  To make it work, two changes were needed:
# ===============================================================
# 1. MANA requires 'mpicc -static' for linking under MPICH.  We saw multiple
#    problems in this.  Hence, it is recommended to build your own MPICH.
#    We found that 'mpicc -static' fails to link with MPICH, unless you
#    configure MPICH with:   ./configure --disable-xml2 --disable-libxml2 ...
#    See the contrib/mpi-proxy-split/INSTALL file for details.

# ===============================================================
# 2. Recent versions of gcc ran into problems with the stack protector.
#    This happens in the DMTCP call to arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS, ...).
#    (Actually, this is called through syscall.)  So, stack protection
#    must be turned off in the files interposing on syscall().  For convenience,
#    we have turned it off everywhere, by setting CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
#    in the 'configure' command, above.
# ===============================================================

# THEN IT COMPILES TO BUILD lh_proxy.
# Note:  also, compiling coordinator_mana.cpp in the plugin requires
#  '#include <mpi.h>' in order to compile the data structure rank_state_t .
#   Because of this, we need to use 'mpicxx' to build the coordinator code.
#   That works.
#   (BUT IS THERE SOMETHING CLEANER?  Perhaps modifying the result of
#    'mpicc -show' can help.)
