This directory contains some useful scripts to work with DMTCP on clusters.
This directory is becoming somewhat crowded, but some particularly useful
utilities to highlight are:

* readdmtcp.sh - read the memory map of a DMTCP checkpoint image (ckpt_*.dmtcp)
* git-bisect.sh - a template for doing 'git bisect run ./git-bisect.sh'
			tests on the DMTCP revision history in git
* gdb-add-symbol-file - After DMTCP restart, the debug symbol information
			for a library in memory may no longer be available,
			since the in-memory copy was restored rather than
			loaded from the library on disk.  This allows you
			to recover debugging symbol information on that library.
* attach_all.py - attach GDB to all ranks at the same time and run a GDB command
			file on every rank. One rank can also be skipped to be debugged
			manually. This is useful to debug issues that only arise on large
			numbers of ranks.

OLD TEXT:
It also contains gdb-add-symbol-file.  Execute it with no arguments
  for instructions on its usage.  It loads library debugging symbols
  into gdb that might not otherwise be there, such as libc-2.7.so.
