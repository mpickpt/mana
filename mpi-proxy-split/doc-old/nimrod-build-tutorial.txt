This document outlines the necessary steps to take to install and compile
NIMROD on Cori, CentOS 7 and CentOS Stream, as well as testing or running it
natively or with MANA.

A. INSTALLING AND COMPILING NIMROD

1. Installing the NIMROD repository

The NIMROD repository is only available to active collaborators. The
instructions to gain access to the repository can be found here:

  https://nimrodteam.org/code_access.html

On Cori, the NIMROD repository has already been installed. However, it's likely
that you will not have access to it unless it's been granted prior. See the
above URL for information on how to get access.

2. Preparing to build NIMROD

On CentOS 7 and CentOS Stream, Bilder requires some packages prior to building.
More information can be found here:

  https://ice.txcorp.com:3000/projects/bilder/wiki/Preparing_a_Linux_machine_for_Bilder

The following sections are of particular note:
  * Java
  * GCC
  * Python 3
  * Additional packages

3. Building NIMROD

NIMROD has the following repository structure:

.
+-- nimall
|   +-- bilder
|   +-- bilderconf
|   +-- configscripts
|       +-- NERSC
|   +-- fciowrappers
|   +-- nimdevel
|   +-- nimtests
|   +-- superlu_dist7
|   +-- xdraw
|   +-- BUILD
|   +-- H5VISIT
|   +-- MAIL
|   +-- NERSC
|   +-- SVN
|   +-- TESTING
|   +-- externalrepos.sh
|   +-- mknimall.sh

The nimall directory contains NIMROD's source code (in lowercase), documentation
for building or testing (capitalized), and scripts that help the installation
process.

### ON CORI ###

Up-to-date configure and build scripts are available on Cori - the directory
containing these scripts can be found in configscripts/NERSC. Make a copy of
these scripts in another directory, depending on whether you require a serial
or parallel build:
  * cori.nersc.gov-nimdevel-{ser,par}-build.sh
  * cori.nersc.gov-nimdevel-{ser,par}-config.sh

In this tutorial, we'll use the parallel build of NIMROD.

In cori.nersc.gov-nimdevel-par-config.sh, you'll have to change two environment
variables:

  # set this variable to wherever you want to install NIMROD
  * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=dir1:dir2:...
  # set the directories after the apostrophe to where your NIMROD source files
  # are - for instance, replace `dir3:dir4:...`
  * -DSUPRA_SEARCH_PATH:PATH='dir1:dir2:...' dir3:dir4:... 

Then run the configure script, followed by the build script. This will install
NIMROD in the former directory.

NOTE: If testing NIMROD with MANA with many ranks is desired, there are some
additional steps required that can be found below, under the first subsection
of 'Testing NIMROD'. It may be also handy to save the output of the build
script.

  $ ./cori.nersc.gov-nimdevel-par-build.sh | tee nimrod-build.log

### ON CENTOS 7 AND CENTOS STREAM ###

## BUILDING NIMROD ##

Building on other operating systems is done with the mknimall.sh script. There
are a few flags to note; you may view the rest by running the script with the -h
flag:

  * -b <build_dir> ... Build in <build_dir>. By default, this is wherever nimall
                       is.
  * -F ............... Force installation of packages that have local
                         modifications. On CentOS 7, there seems to be an issue
                         whereby the build process modifies the SuperLU_DIST
                         source as part of the build process, and the script
                         doesn't install the package. Consequently, the
                         parallel version of NIMROD can't find it to link, and
                         is built without it, causing subsequent run-time
                         problems.
  * -f ............... Install all packages.
  * -i <install_dir> . Set comma delimited list of installation directories for
                         code in subdirs. By default, this is $HOME/software.
  * -j <n> ........... Maximum number of build processes summed over all builds.
                         NIMROD will take about 40 minutes to build if n=1.
  * -t ............... Run tests after building.

Run the mknimall.sh with the necessary flags. I've found the following to work
best:

  $ ./mknimall.sh -F -j 8 -t

See below for comments on cases where NIMROD failed to build on the first try,
and we had to then modify portion and re-build.

The script creates a new directory, builds, in <build_dir>:

.
+-- nimall
|   +-- builds
|       +-- ...
|       +-- cmake-3.20.3
|       +-- ...
|       +-- mpich-3.4.2
|       +-- ...
|       +-- mknimall.log
|       +-- mknimall-summary.txt
|       +-- ...
|   +-- ...

The 'builds' directory contains the source code for all the packages used in
NIMROD's build process. If the packages need to be rebuilt (for instance, if a
debug version of MPICH is desired), they can be built separately.

It also contains logs of the previous build processes. To debug the build
process, it's helpful to look at the latest mknimall.log, which will show the
following:

  SUMMARY

  illios executed ./mknimall.sh -t -j 8 on reached at Fri Apr 22 11:26:44 PDT 2022.

  SUCCESS - Installations: ...

  Configure successes: ...
  Configure failures: ... 
  Build successes: ...
  Build failures: ... 
  Installation successes: ... 
  Installation failures: ...
  No tests were run.

Here, we can gather which packages failed, and where in the process. The log
also gives more detailed information in each subsection:

    Bilder examining netcdf_fortran (2022-04-06-23:47:45)
  ========================================================
  buildNetcdf_fortran already known.
  [buildChain] Dependencies are NETCDF_FORTRAN_DEPS = netcdf hdf5 cmake.
  [buildChain] Builds are NETCDF_FORTRAN_BUILDS = sersh par.

  [buildChain] EXECUTING buildNetcdf_fortran
  ...
  Package netcdf_fortran-4.2-par failed to configure at 2022-04-06-23:47:51.

  [buildChain] EXECUTING testNetcdf_fortran
  ...

  [buildChain] EXECUTING installNetcdf_fortran
  ...

  [buildChain] EXECUTING findNetcdf_fortran
  ...

Bilder checks the installation of each package in three steps and reports its
status at the end of each step. In the example above, netcdf_fortran failed to
configure. nimall/BUILD summarizes the debugging steps succinctly:

  For a successfully installed package there are three shell scripts created in
  the build directory (see below) corresponding to each step. These scripts are
  named *-config.sh, *-build.sh and *-install.sh where the wildcard value is
  machine and package dependent. There are also three output files corresponding
  to each step, *-config.txt, *-build.txt and *-install.txt. When a package
  fails on a step, the first thing to check is the error located in the output
  file corresponding to the failed step.

Some issues that you may face are:
  * conflicting gfortran packages ..... devtoolset-8-gcc-gfortran should be
                                        necessary.
  * conflicting BLAS packages ......... blas-static and openblas-static should
                                        be necessary. Note that the former
                                        doesn't exist on CentOS Stream.
  * PyTables not installed ............ Install PyTables for Python 3:
                                          python3 -m pip install --user packaging
                                          python3 -m pip install --user numpy
                                          python3 -m pip install --user tables
  * superlu_dist7 built but not found . See the -F flag above more details.

4. Testing NIMROD

### ON CORI ###

Please ask an administrator for access to the test case on Cori.

To run it, navigate to the given directory. Either submit a batch script or run
it manually.

  $ salloc -N 11 -C haswell -q interactive -t 00:15:00 # customize yourself
  $ mana_coordinator # optionally; refer to MANA documentation for installation
  $ srun \
      --ntasks=88 \
      --ntasks-per-node=8 \
      --cpus-per-task=2 \
      --cpu-bind=cores \
      MANA_BIN/mana_launch \   # optionally
      /path/to/nimrod

The test case provided on Cori has to be ran with the number of MPI ranks being
a multiple of 11. This corresponds to the number of tasks.

NOTE: Currently, when restarting above a certain number of ranks, NIMROD's
execution may halt after a while (and we know that this issue will always be
seen above 704 ranks, although this is not a definite lower bound). This is due
to a heap overflow; the memory map below provides a clearer picture of the
issue (dev and inode columns are omitted):

00400000-031b0000 r-xp 00000000  /global/cfs/cdirs/cr/illios/nimall/bin/nimrod
033b0000-033da000 r-xp 02db0000  /global/cfs/cdirs/cr/illios/nimall/bin/nimrod
033da000-0340d000 rwxp 02dda000  /global/cfs/cdirs/cr/illios/nimall/bin/nimrod
0340d000-0395c000 rwxp 00000000  [heap] 
0e000000-0e47c000 r-xp 00000000  /global/u1/i/illios/mana/bin/lh_proxy
0e67b000-0e68a000 rwxp 00000000  /global/u1/i/illios/mana/bin/lh_proxy
0e68a000-0e6fd000 rwxp 00000000  /global/u1/i/illios/mana/bin/lh_proxy

If the heap grows too much, it risks overflowing into the text section of the
lower half, causing a segmentation fault. An attempted solution was to increase
the memory address of the lower half, but it could only be increased to a maximum
of 0x80000000, in which the heap still overflows. A devised workaround is to
swap the memory region for the lower half and NIMROD, such that the heap can
grow freely.

As of 14 June '22, building MANA now builds two copies of `lh_proxy` that
are loaded into different addresses, 0x400000 and 0xe000000, with the
former named `lh_proxy_default_address`. `mana_launch` will now check if
the application being run is NIMROD, in which `lh_proxy_default_address`
will be loaded instead.

A version of NIMROD with the text segment specified to load at 0xe000000 has
also been built and is available as a module on Cori. On other platforms, it is
necessary to follow the steps below.

  $ module use /global/cfs/cdirs/cr/mvm/modulefiles
  $ module avail nimrod # you should see nimrod/r7643-mana
  $ module load nimrod/r7643-mana

OTHER PLATFORMS:
When linking NIMROD, it's necessary to add a flag specifying where it should be
loaded (by default, this is 0x400000). The command can be found in the output of
the build script, prepended by "[ 90%] Linking Fortran executable ../bin/nimrod".

Add a `-Wl,-Ttext-segment=E000000` flag to the build command, then run ONLY the
command.

### ON CENTOS 7 AND CENTOS STREAM ###

The source code of the test cases can be found in nimall/nimtests/tests. If the
mknimall.sh was run with the -t flag, the following scripts should be found in
the nimall/nimtests directory:
  * reached-nimtests-all-config.sh
  * reached-nimtests-all-build.sh

As above, run the configure script followed by the build script, and refer to
the respective .txt files for debugging.

On the first run of reached-nimtests-all-build.sh or the first time calling
`make runtests`, all tests will fail. This is because NIMROD's tests check for
completion and correctness. The tests will not only run until they are finished,
but also check against a previous iteration's results. To populate the
results directory, run `make replace` after running the tests after the first
time.

To run a test individually, navigate to its directory. Each test in the
directory has a script that will set up the necessary paths and variables, run
nimset to generate the dump file, run nimrod, and do some clean-up.

5. Appendix for developers: modifying and re-building NIMROD

As best written in the DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW section of nimall/builds:

  Rebuilding with bilder is not required when a change is made to the NIMROD
  source files. In fact, rebuilding with bilder is also not recommended for
  development.  If an svn repo is not clean (e.g. nimall/nimdevel has local
  modifications) bilder will not install the code unless passed the -F flag. If
  the -F flag is passed the modified code will be installed with the -rXXXXM tag
  where XXXX is the svn repo revision number.  The softlinks in the $NIMSOFT
  (install) directory will be updated to point to this installation and thus the
  binary placed in the PATH variable when nimall.sh is sourced will be updated.
  
  The recommended workflow for development is work directly in the <build
  directory>/nimdevel/<ser/par> directories with debug builds (see below).
  Execute
  
    $ make
  
  to rebuild and incorporate your changes. Use
  
    $ make -j4
  
  to build in parallel with 4 processors. These commands will produce a modified
  binaries in the <build directory>/nimdevel/<ser/par>/bin directory. One can
  install these binaries with
  
    $ make install
  
  however this is not recommended as it will corrupt the installation directory
  naming system. NIMROD uses a cmake build system and available build targets
  are shown with
  
    $ make help
  
  When new source files are added, the corresponding CMakeLists.txt file must be
  changed in the source code directory and the new file added to the svn repo.
