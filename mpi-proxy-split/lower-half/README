This lower-half program has the capability of:
1. Linking to an MPI library and initializing it
2. Executing a "kernel-laoder" that will load the upp-half program (the user
   MPI program containing the MPI application code).
3. Restoring the upper-half program at the time of restart.

During launch, it (1) calls MPI_Init to initialize the MPI library in
the lower-half. Then (2) writes the lh_info address to an environment
variable MANA_LH_INFO_ADDR so that the upper-half program (including DMTCP
and MANA's wrappers) knows information of the lower-half program. After
setting up, the lower-half program (3) execute a "kernel-loader" to load
the upper-half program.

When an MPI function is called in the upper-half, the MANA MPI wrapper
functions in the upper-half will redirect the call to the real MPI
function linked with the lower-half program.

During restart, it (1) calls MPI_Init to get its global MPI rank number
in order to find the corresponding checkpoint image file. Then (2)
connects to the DMTCP coordinator, and (3) uses DMTCP APIs to restore
the upper-half program. During restart, the lh_info address is shared
using an external file because environment variables inthe upper-half
are inheritated from the checkpoint time, instead of from the lower-half
program. These temp files will be saved in the /tmp/ directory, and
cleaned after the upper-half program is properly restored. The filename
format is "mana_tmp_lh_info_[hostname]_[pid]".
