This is a definition of gethostbyname/getaddrinfo that can be statically
linked into your executable;  the code forks a child, which execs
into a dynamically linked program, which can then call gethostbyname
or getaddrinfo dynamically, and report back the results to the
statically linked parent.

See:
  https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/cs-info.html#gethostbyname

for a longer description of the history of how glibc decided that
gethostbyname/getaddrinfo would be deprecated and eventually completely
removed from all statically linked programs in Linux.

This author does not agree with the arguments for not allowing
statically linked programs to call gethostbyname.  musl continues
to support this.  And if glibc will not support it, then this author will.
