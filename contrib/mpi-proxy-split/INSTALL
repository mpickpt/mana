[E-mail instructions as of May 28, 2020.  Revise this when MANA is more stable.]

Hi Zhengji,
    Here is a revised version of my instructions for running MANA.
I'm also adding these instructions to:
      $MANA_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/INSTALL

The main pointers are:

MANA at github:
  https://github.com/mpickpt/mana/tree/refactoring
  (the refactoring branch of https://github.com/mpickpt/mana ).
and MANA documentation:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pT25gvMNeT1Vz4SU6Gp4Hx9MGLfkK8ZK-sSOwtu5R50/edit

Eventually, we'll have a better Makefile, and scripts for this:
  mpi_mana_launch, mpi_mana_restart, mpi_mana_status.
But for now, we're still modifying it.

At this time, the steps to build MANA (on Cori) are roughly as follows.

  module unload craype-hugepages2M
  # Modify the salloc command according to your needs:
  salloc -N 1 -C haswell -q interactive -t 03:00:00
  git clone https://github.com/mpickpt/mana
  git checkout refactoring  # current development branch; later to be 'master'
  cd mana
  # Development branch.  (Eventually, the 'master' branch will be preferred.)
  git checkout refactoring
  ./configure
  make -j  # Build in source directory: create bin, lib directories.
  pushd contrib/mpi-proxy-split  # Go to plugin directory.
  (cd test && make -j)
  make install
  pushd  # Go back to the MANA root directory
  make -j  # Make it again. The plugin 'make' added an extra file to core DMTCP.
  pushd  # Go back to plugin directory: mpi-proxy-split
  cd test # We're now in:  contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test

And then to test it, my instructions here are based on our very informal
notes on Cori at:
  ~gdc0/public/commands-wednesday.history
The working notes may change, and we'll then propagate the changes to these instructions.)

Roughly, to test MANA, do:
  export MANA_ROOT=$HOME/mana  # Adjust for your directory.
  cd $MANA_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test
  make tidy # Remove old ckpt files from a previous session.
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_coordinator --mpi -q -q --exit-on-last --daemon
  # This does interval checkpointing every 5 seconds.
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_launch -i5 --host `hostname` --no-gzip --join --disable-dl-plugin --with-plugin $PWD/../libmana.so ./mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
  # [ creates ckpt:   ls ckpt_rank_*/ckpt_*.dmtcp ]
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_coordinator --mpi -q -q --exit-on-last --daemon
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_restart --host `hostname` --join --mpi ckpt_rank_*/ckpt_*.dmtcp

As I said earlier, we will later simplify all of this with a better Makefile
and scripts for launch, restart, and status.  But right now, this branch
is still under development.

Best,

================================================================================
Debugging internals of MANA:

Wherever you see '$MANA_ROOT', replace it with 'DMTCP_MANA_PAUSE=1 $DMTCP_ROOT'
  and run the command in the background.  (Add '&' to the end of the command.)
It will stop with a printout about how to attach in GDB.  Execute that command.
Then:  (gdb) p dummy=0

When debugging in GDB, you can switch back and forth between upper half and
lower half programs as follows (assuming you're in .../mpi-proxy-split/test).
This is useful for examining both the upper and lower half stacks.
  (gdb) file ../../../lh_proxy
  (gdb) file ../mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
If you had previously set aa breakpoint before switching, then use:
  (gdb) set breakpoint always-inserted on
before switching among lower and upper halves.

================================================================================
Building and testing on ordinary CentOS/Ubuntu (not Cori):

Building outside of Cori is a little more involved.
1.  git checkout test-dekaksi    # This will be merged into refactoring later.
2.  Instead of './configure', do 'sh configure-mana'.  In some cases, you may
    or may not have to modify the 'configure-mana' script.
3.  When you do 'make -j' inside contrib/mpi-proxy-split, it will fail on
    linking in the lower-half subdirectory.  To fix this, do:
      cd lower-half
        # The current variant of this command can be found in
        # $DMTCP_ROOT/configure-mana .  Adjust the paths for your local setup.
      gcc -g -static -Wl,-Ttext-segment -Wl,0xE000000 -Wl,--wrap -Wl,__munmap -Wl,--wrap -Wl,shmat -Wl,--wrap -Wl,shmget -o lh_proxy lh_proxy.o libproxy.a -lmpi -llzma -lrt -lpthread -lc libproxy.a -llzma -I$PWD/../../../../mpich-3.3.2-build/include -L$PWD/../../../../mpich-3.3.2-build/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,$PWD/../../../../mpich-3.3.2-build/lib/ -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -lmpi -lm  -lbacktrace -lpthread -lrt
      make -j
      cd ..
      make install  # Same as original directions.
      cd $DMTCP_ROOT && make -j  # Same as original directions

Testing and running is mostly the same as described at the top.
When testing at your site, you may need to use 'mpirun' instead of 'srun'.

A further complication tends to occur when using 'mpirun'.  The lower half,
lh_proxy, was compiled statically with libc.a.  However, libc.a does
not directly support gethostbyname and getaddrinfo.  Instead, it tries
to load libnss_*.so.  But we wanted lh_proxy to be statically linked so
that it would consist only of text/data/stack, and later calls to mmap.

(This tends not to occur on HPC clusters, where we are more likely to
use 'srun', and anyway, where the network interface will be a custom
one (InfiniBand, Cray GNI, etc.).  So, it is less likely that libc.a
calls libnss_*.so.)

The workaround for 'mpirun' (at least for the MPICH-based family
of implementations) is to use:
  ifconfig -a
to discover what network interfaces are available on the HPC cluster.
Then call mpirun during launch and restart with an additional flag:
  mpirun -iface eth0 ...
(or with another network interface indicated by 'ifconfig -a')
