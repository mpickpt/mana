When ./configure-mana is called in MANA, it calls ./configure, which
in turn configures the DMTCP submodule as:
  ./configure ... --enable-debug CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector CXXFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector MPI_BIN=/usr/local/bin ...  --with-mana-helper-dir=../restart_plugin --disable-dlsym-wrapper ...

Hence, '--with-mana-helper-dir' above points to this directory.

In ../dmtcp/src/mtcp/Makefile.in, it has hardwired MANA-specific code
to compile the local filenames here as object files in ../dmtcp/src/mtcp:

ifneq ($(MANA_HELPER_DIR),)
  HEADERS += $(MANA_HELPER_DIR)/mtcp_split_process.h \
             $(MANA_HELPER_DIR)/ucontext_i.h
  OBJS += mtcp_restart_plugin.o mtcp_split_process.o getcontext.o
  CFLAGS += -DMTCP_PLUGIN_H="<lower_half_api.h>"
  INCLUDES += -I$(MANA_HELPER_DIR)
endif 

(Note that MANA_HELPER_DIR was set by ./configure using --with-mana-helper-dir.)

====
When MANA restarts using mana_restart, the relevant logic is found in the
files of this directory (at the time of restart) and
../mpi-proxy-split/mpi_plugin.cpp (earlier at the time of checkpoint).

mpi_plugin.cpp has written libsStart, libsEnd and highMemStart into the
MTCP header of each checkpoint image at the time of checkpoint.

At the time of checkpoint, control comes to:
  ../mpi-proxy-split/mpi_plugin.cpp:computeUnionOfCkptImageAddresses()
    (i) which computes libsStart, libsEnd, highMemStart
    (ii) and saves it in the MTCP header of the checkpoint image,
    (iii) such that [libsStart, libsEnd]+[highMemStart, STACK] should
          cover all memory regions of the upper half for every rank.

At the time of restart, control comes to:
  ../dmtcp/src/mtcp/mtcp_restart.c:main() ->
  mtcp_restart_plugin.c:mtcp_plugin_hook() ->
  mtcp_split_process.c:splitProcess() -> 
  mtcp_split_process.c:initializeLowerHalf() -> 
    (i) mtcp_split_process.c:splitProcess()
          // forks proxy process for lower half
          // and then copies it into cur. process
    (ii) initializes the lower half with libc_start_main (now that it is
         in the current process)
    (iii) returns to 'splitProcess()', which returns to 'mtcp_plugin_hook()':
  mtcp_restart_plugin.c:mtcp_plugin_hook() ->
    (i) We finished 'splitProcess()', above.
    (ii) reserve_fds_upper_half()
         reserveUpperHalfMemoryRegionsForCkptImgs() // mmap memory regions
                                                    // of future upper half
    (iii) JUMP_TO_LOWER_HALF()
    (iv) // MPI_Init is called here. Network memory areas are loaded by MPI_Init
         // Also, MPI_Cart_create will be called to restore cartesian topology.
         // Based on the coordinates, checkpoint image is restored instead of
         // world rank.
         // This includes /dev/xpmem, *shared_mem*, etc.
    (v) RETURN_TO_UPPER_HALF()
    (vi) releaseUpperHalfMemoryRegionsForCkptImgs()
         unreserve_fds_upper_half()
    (vii) getCkptImageByRank() // Sets ckpt image for upper half for this rank
    (viii) returns to ../dmtcp/src/mtcp/mtcp_restart.c:main()
  ../dmtcp/src/mtcp/mtcp_restart.c:main() ->
    (i) Load ckpt image file found by 'mtcp_plugin_hook()'
    (ii) Control passes to program counter and stack from time of checkpoint
    (iii) The upper half then rebinds MPI wrappers, etc.

DEBUGGING mana_restart:
  Note that the coordinator dumps a *.json file in the directory where the
    coordinator was launched, at the time of checkpoint (and during restart).
    The checkpoint version includes:
      libsStart, libsEnd, highMemStart, and the /proc/*/maps during checkpoint.
  This can be used to verify that [libsStart, libsEnd]+[highMemStart, STACK]
    truly covers all upper-half memory regions.
  This can also be checked in GDB by comparing /proc/self/maps inside
    ../dmtcp/src/mtcp/mtcp_restart.c:main() just before it loads the
    checkpoint image file, with the /proc/self/maps when afterward executing
    the statement 'case DMTCP_EVENT_RESTART:' in the file
    ../mpi-proxy-split/mpi_plugin.cpp.
